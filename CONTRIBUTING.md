# Contributing to list

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the awesome annual reviews and trends list!

Please bare in mind that unlike our other lists (ie [Prod ML list](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning)), the criteria for selection is less quantifiable as we cannot set metrics such as activity, number of stars, maintenance, etc. Because of this, the list below are a set of principles used for the selection process, and the final decision will be left for the maintainers, with any exception awarded explicitly.

The key things to bare in mind when contributing a new list are the following:

* This is not an exhaustive listing
* The articles must be technical as opposed to business / high level
* The selection process has preference towards open source
* Resources must be from renowned organisations or renowned individuals
* Promotional and advertisement articles are not relevant
* Sparse blog posts with predictions or year in reviews are not relevant
* Exceptions are done if resources are specialised on areas not covered with comprehensive high quality content
* Ordering is in alphabetical order

In order to add a new section, more than 3 articles need to be proposed at the same time, and should be discussed in an issue

# Thank you very much!

We really appreciate your support! If you have any questions please feel free to open an issue.
